    Style (<style>)
    ===========================================================================

    Defines style information for a document, typically CSS.

    Variables:
    - `style_content`: The CSS content to be included inside the <style> element. Defaults to "/* Default CSS styles */".

    Notes:
    - The `| e` filter is used to escape any special characters in the variables to prevent XSS attacks. However, in this case, it is not necessary as CSS content should not be escaped.
