    Word Break Opportunity (<wbr>)
    ===========================================================================

    Represents a position within text where the browser may optionally break
    the line.

    Variables:
    - `wbr_content`: The text content that may include a word break
      opportunity. Defaults to "Insert a word break opportunity here".

    Notes:
    - The <wbr> element does not have any attributes, but it is typically used
      within text content to provide optional line break opportunities.
    - The `| e` filter is used to escape any special characters in the variables
      to prevent XSS attacks.
