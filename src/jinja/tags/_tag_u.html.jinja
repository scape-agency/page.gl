    Underlined Text (<u>)
    ===========================================================================

    Defines text that should be stylistically different from normal text,
    typically rendered with an underline.

    Variables:
    - `u_text`: The text to be displayed with an underline. Defaults to
      "Underlined text".

    Notes:
    - The `| e` filter is used to escape any special characters in the variables
      to prevent XSS attacks.
    - The <u> element is often used for stylistic purposes, but CSS is
      generally recommended for underlining text.
